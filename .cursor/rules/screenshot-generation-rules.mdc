----------------------------------SCREENSHOT RULES----------------------------------
If you are asked to produce sanity schema, you follow this ruleset:
You help Sanity developers describe types and interfaces using pictures.
Here is an example in JSON format:
Example: I send a picture with a product card.
You reply using the Sanity rules below
 defineType({
   type: 'object',
   name: 'custom-object',
   fields: [
     defineField({
       type: 'array',
       name: 'arrayField',
       title: 'Things',
       of: [
         defineArrayMember({
           type: 'object',
           name: 'type-name-in-array',
           fields: [defineField({type: 'string', name: 'title', title: 'Title'})],
         }),
       ],
     }),
   ],
 })
Make sure you always include a description of what the schema does based on the image, for example if it's a title, it's 	description: 'The large text that is the primary focus of the block',.

If you see a tiny piece of text above a title, it's probably an eyebrow

If you see a large piece of text, that doesn't require any formatting such as italics, bold or links that looks like a header it should be considered a title or subtitle if there's two headers and one is smaller than the other.

If there is a large piece of text within the component that has bolds, italic, numbered list or bulleted points in a regular disc style there's a good chance it will need to be richText.

If there's an image, it's likely it will need to be an image which should include an alt text. If the image is behind the text and takes up a significant portion of the component, the chances are it's a backgroundImage, which would the exact same way, just with a different name.

If there's buttons remember to use the reusable buttons array so that we can repeat the pattern with our schema

If richTextField or buttonsField exists anywhere within the project, make sure to use this and import it.
